## humanure

Most of our human waste composting learning came from `The Humanure Handbook`. Jake has a digital copy and Steven has a paper copy he foolishly left in India (2019).

## carbon

Pine needles make great carbon. There is a collection under some trees on the far side of the meadow. Six full, level wheel barrows fill the carbon box.

It's okay for the compost to get wet (good, in fact) but the carbon needs to stay dry.

## poopin'

Splash some water on the inside of a 5 galon pale and line it with newspaper. Add 3 scoops of peat moss to the bottom and it's ready for poops. When it's about 2/3 or 3/4 full, seal the lid and put it under the toilet platform. Once there are two full buckets, dump them in the composter and give them a rinse with well water. Cover thoroughly with carbon. There should be no smell and no flies.

## other organics

It's easiest to add the food waste when you dump the poop buckets, but timings don't always line up. Cover food waste in plenty of carbon. Smells are bad, flies are bad.
