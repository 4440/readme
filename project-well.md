Hi Steve,

These prices seem expensive. Is there a Maxxam Analytics where you are? Last time I did a WQ test (albeit it was in Calgary in 2013), it cost maybe $80-100 and I got a whole package of WQ parameters. 

If this is your only tester company, I say get the Budget + ICP. I don't really understand why the ultimate is more expensive than the budget but has less parameters? Weird. 

From a cross section of both lists, I'd say you want:

- arsenic, because it's groundwater. Not sure what the geological properties are on site, but just in case. 
- bacteria is probably a must, though I'm guessing your going to chlorinate regardless? P/A is fine
- sodium a must
- ammonia, could interfere with chlorine disinfection
- calcium, magnesium, hardness are kind of aesthetic, but i guess it doesn't hurt to find out. It'll affect plumbing, but I'm guessing that's not that big of a concern
- pH would be nice, but same as above for corrosion etc. 
- lead is usually from plumbing, so this is a bit unnecessary but i guess if they are including it for free. 

This Budget +ICP package is probably all you need. 

I would also like to see turbidity and total organic carbon (TOC), but since these are pay individually ones, and you can somewhat already guess what they will be just by looking at your water. These are more indicator parameters (basically, how much colour reflecting dirt or organic matter in your water, which is not harmful in itself but could mean more risk of bacteria or harder to disinfect. Also, if TOC and turbidity are high, this probably means your water will taste bad (again, not necessarily harmful for health). If these are high, I'd recommend getting a water filter. Or upping your chlorine dose (which won't remove the taste issues, but would help with the harder to disinfect bacteria that may be hiding amongst the organic matter). 

That was a really long winded way of saying pick the Budget + ICP one. 

Can I see the results once you get them?
