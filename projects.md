These are more-or-less in priority order. The dock makes it easy to transport drinking water
and it's unlikely we'll want to filter well water if it's as yellow as 2016 anyway. We should
still clean the well, even if it's only for wash water.

A "patio" is just a flat surface in behind the cabin for cooking on the propane stove, since
the first wood stove is completely rusted out. That will provide a space for building a roof
to act as a cook house.

If we can install a shipping container, that takes priority over a tool shed. The tool shed is
largely aesthetic (and convenient). The container could act as a toolshed and legit storage.

The "dawn platform" and hot bath are obviously just luxuries.
